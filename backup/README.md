# History of the models built along the project

1. **model_00.h5**: Build a simple Neural Network with only one fully-connected layer. Used to test the simulator.

2. **model_01.h5**: Build LeNet-5 Neural Network without dropout or regularization techniques. Images has been converted to grayscale, resized to 32x32, and normalized.

3. **model_02.h5**: Augment data by flipping each center image around y-axis.

4. **model_03.h5**: Augment data by adding left and right images.

4. **model_04.h5**: Crop images to save only the region of interest.

5. **model_05.h5**: Convert image from BGR to RGB. Use generator for training. Finetune the model and collect more data.
